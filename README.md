## Design

Go Again uses a Neo-Brutalist design which I have come across a few times on the web.
I wanted to give this style a try and I was pretty happy with how it turned out.
[This article](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-can-i-design-in-the-neo-brutalism-style-d85c458042de) was a really helpful with the colour scheme and styling some of the components such as the cards and buttons.

## Tech

This was my first time using Firebase in a project. I used Firebase for Authentication and my DB.
I used [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-full-stack-app-with-nextjs13-and-firebase/) for initial set up and then learnt how to use Firbase as I went.
While a little bit confusing at first, I eventually got the hang of it and was able to build all of the CRUD functionality I needed.

I also used Tailwind for the first time. I enjoyed using it and it was quite easy to keep my components consistent across the app.
I traditionally use vanilla css with css variables so it wasn't too big of a jump into Tailwind. The [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) are great and if you have a bit of experience with CSS then it is easy enough to search for the property you are looking for.
Tailwind is something I would use again and I can definetly see its appeal to large projects worked on by multiple people.
